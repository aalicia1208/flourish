# welcome to flourish!


## about
this app has the target of encouraging users to become more environmentally friendly. users can journal about a sustainable action they've performed, then submit it and get a suitable number of points for their actions. points can be spent in the garden to purchase plants, which can be planted in a personal garden. users can see their stats such as journaling streak, top categories, and a leaderboard for points.

## notes
this app requires an api key for openai and firebase (which is, of course, not included in the files); the secrets file must be filled in with our keys to use the app (it currently has placeholder keys)! :)

## misc
this app was submitted for the congressional app challenge in 2025.
